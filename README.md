# Chess

## Introduction
This project was started as a way to review JavaScript, HTML, and CSS functionality while programming a game I am passionate about playing, Chess. This is a work in progress and as such will be updated over time. Currently the game is functioning at a basic level, allowing for basic play. However, complicated chess moves such as "Castling" or "En Passant" have not yet been implemented

## Usage
This game is best utilized in Visual Studio Code with the "Live Server" extension. With this extention installed, the user can secondary click the index.html file and click the "Open with Live Server" option to open the game in a LocalHost Tab.

## Instructions
Players will start the game clicking the appropriately named "Start Game" button. Following this the players can either type the appropriate rows and columns of their desired pieces and their destinations or click the pieces and spaces themselves to advance.
